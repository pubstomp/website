This movie breaks the mold, but preserves many of the tie ins that make this a Predator movie. This time we get to see the interaction with a Predator and a tribe of Commanche while following the story of a young lady, Naru, as she tries to define her own path.&lt;br>

A new Marvel hero that has the ability to jump between universes was introduced &amp;ndash; America Chavez.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Join us as we discuss the high and low points of this movie.&lt;br>

In general, it&amp;rsquo;s a very enjoyable movie, but don&amp;rsquo;t expect any big brain connections to the other movies, at least none that we could detect.&lt;br>

24:55 The first bank heist was very meta&lt;br>
26:08 Introducing the cast&lt;br>
26:48 The love triangle throughout the movie is very predictable&lt;br>
28:45 Is screaming a German thing? Nah, just Dieter being Dieter.&lt;br>
29:41 There&amp;rsquo;s a tragic story behind the builder of the safes&lt;br>
30:59 The ridiculousness of the safe&amp;rsquo;s difficulty was alluring&lt;br>
33:14 The betrayal scene was rough&lt;br>
34:00 mexy swears he saw a tentacle zombie but it was show girl&lt;br>
36:36 Hoping this movie had aliens to tie up to the previous one&lt;br>
37:38 Third movie in the series is Planet of the Dead&lt;br>
40:05 If Planet of the Dead ties up both movies, mexy will eat another chip&lt;br>
43:08 Not a bad movie, but pales in comparison to Army of the Dead&lt;br>

&lt;pre>&lt;code>One thing I couldn't, couldn't ever stomach about living in Santa Carla.
All the damn vampires, what you're going to hear about today is nothing short
of a miracle. Hello, everybody. Welcome to Pub Stomp, a podcast about games,
TV shows, movies and pop culture in general. Every episode we discuss topics
that we find interesting come join our shenanigans. Hey, you! Welcome to
another episode of Pub Stomp podcast. As you can tell, my quality kind of
sucks is my fault. My mistake? But it doesn't matter because we're going to be
talking about an 80s movie called The Lost Boys. If you haven't seen this
movie, it's probably going to be. It's you can watch it on the plane. You can
watch it on anything. But it's it's it's very. We'll talk about it. Don't
worry about it. Anyway, we know what's up, Tyler. How's it going? There's
something sexy. Howdy. Man, I've seen you guys so much in the past few weeks.
It's like. No, no, I still I still don't like. I still want to move back to
Arizona. It's just so dry, so dry. I miss the trees, man, man. But don't worry
about the trees because we were inside watching TV, right? There was some big
announcement. DC FanDome, something like that. I didn't catch it, but you guys
told me about it. Some of you were excited about some stuff more than others.
Maybe Mexican. Tell us about Superman. I don't know what movies too soon.
Superman was outside of it. Oh, outside of it, outside of the DC FanDome. So
then you can still tell us a little bit later. So what was what was the DC
fandom was just a bunch of movies that got announced. It's kind of like the
Disney like, so people don't go to San Diego Comic-Con anymore. They everybody
does their own thing. And so Disney has been doing theirs for a while now, and
last year, because of COVID is DC was like, You know what? We can do our own
one two in the DC FanDome was born. So this is the first year now this is the
second year they do it. Gotcha. Pretty, pretty big deal, pretty big deal. Um,
they announced they showed like trailers for the new Batman. They announced
the actual release date, which is March 4th next year. They showed the first
trailer for Black Adam, which was huge. Everybody's like Black Adam because
it's the rock doing Black Adam. Oh yeah, nice. I need to watch the trailer.
Um, and then they show the teaser for The Flash, which is some kind of
multiverse thing, if you know Disney's in their multiverse, so why not? Um,
and then they show their real aerials for the new Aquaman and then the new
Shazam movie that's coming out as well. So, okay, a lot of like announcements.
And then they did the teaser for the Peacemaker show. See, that's the one I
care about. Everything else is like, Yeah, it's all right, peacemaker, because
it's so funny that that's the one you picked. That's awesome. I mean, because
from the movie we watch, was it called Suicide Squad, you kind of have a
connection. All the other characters. It's so different from what I grew up
with. I grew up with like the cartoons and then the games. And then like, it's
like whole world differently. It's just not the same. So peacemaker about
things coming together exactly why I didn't care about it now, but I guess I
have to care now because everybody's putting everything together. So why are
you making movies so complicated? You run a pop culture podcast. You need to
care. Anyways, this is my two cents. I showed some video game trailers like
Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League. That's pretty cool. It had a lot of
cool stuff to show. Okay. Do you have to pay to attend this event, or is it
just like I mean, I went to The Verge sitcom and I saw what they announced, so
I don't know if the event is like, you pay and then you can watch it.
Honestly, I have no idea. Since I'm not a huge DC fan, I never really care to
look at like, how do you go? I just woke up and YouTube was filled with DC
trailers. I know they do it online, like they do streams online and stuff, but
I don't know if people can actually go. Last year, obviously not because.
Kelvin, cool. Yeah, that's that's cool, man. So I mean, Superman announcement.
What was that part of them? Oh boy, the internet love this internet. So on
national coming out day, you see, oh, there's there's a date for that. I don't
know that there's a date for it. That's why it's a big deal. National coming
out day. They announced that Jonathan Kent, Superman's son, is no sexual. No,
not the reaction all the way. There you go. I'm just I'm I'm sorry to be like,
No way. I don't know. Look, you had already told me this. That's all. I'm
trying to be organic here. But yeah, man, that's that's cool. Look, I think
it's more shocking once you see like that. So when you hear it, it's like, All
right, it's not a big deal. But then when you see, like the Superman suit and
then he's kissing, kissing a little boy or like, I don't know if it's a little
boy kissing a little, whoa, whoa. He's like, sex, I'm not a pedophile. It's
just like, it's a young boy, a young man, young man. There you go. He also let
me get the young man there, two young men kissing each other. Look, man, it's
just like with the muscles. Superman looks older. You know, he's like, ripped,
right? It's just like, Oh, I honestly have no problem with it. He can do
whatever he wants to do. So, hey, man, more power to you. But then so why?
What was it? A big deal? Because they were like, Oh, my Superman doesn't kiss
man. He's red blooded American. And, you know, it's like, Well, this is not
American. Like, he was like, I was going, I was going to say he was born in
America, but you know, he was raised in America, right? He raised the red,
white and blue. I mean, I don't care. I think it's ridiculous. And it's not
like we're losing the straight Superman. We just have another character who we
don't know if he's straight. We don't know. Well, yes, he could have been
faking this whole time. He could be by. He's in love with Louis Lane. We know
that for a fact, but not by any means. You like both. Right? This is what I'm
saying, man. We have this character. He's straight as far as anybody knows,
and now we have this other character and people, you know, he's bisexual. It
doesn't. You're not losing one to get the other one right? You keep. You have
both. It's OK. You can have two Superman's like. And it doesn't really matter
because there's like different like. Uh, what is it, multiverses of Superman's
right like, so if one of them's gay, who cares? I mean, there's bound to be
one that's gay, right, because if you have a multiverse, it's a probability.
Yeah, well, it's like it's just such a non-issue that people made it an issue.
Yeah, but I mean, I'm yeah, but also like, you know, like, you know, DC was
angling and stuff like, Yeah, let's stir the pot, let's make some noise. No,
DC was super excited to do this because the guy who's writing it, it was like,
Hey, can we do this? And they were like, Yeah, hell yeah. Because like I said,
it doesn't like the way that I heard it explained by the guy who was like, if
one were like having a bisexual Superman, you don't lose anything. There's
nothing that's lost there. But if you have one and certain people are
represented, finally, you just gained a bunch of people finally seeing
themselves somewhere else, right? You're not you're not losing the straight
Superman. You're just gaining, you know, a bisexual Superman. And it's fine.
Like, it's like, who cares, right? You're not losing anything to gain
something. And I think that's the mentality that a lot of people have that see
this as wrong. It's like, Oh yeah, I'm losing my Superman, and you're not. So
shut up. Yeah, I'm not crying because I don't have a Mexican super man, I'm
just saying the one Mexican Superman, they did it. He's evil, kind of. Yeah,
but I mean, we did lose somebody. Kanye West, it's no longer kind of. Oh, he's
still can you? He's now Jay-Z. His Uist. No, I think his name is just, you
know, Oh, it's just your last name. No. OK. I pretty much became a symbol.
Nice. OK, cool. Anyway, I'm really going to have the same effect. That was a
random tried, but it doesn't matter. Well, that's that's the that's the news.
A lot of DC stuff coming up if you read the comics. Going to get a different
flavor of Superman, which is exciting. I think you have to see the pictures.
I'll put a little post in the show notes. I think it does make. It does make a
splash. Let's just say that, so it's cool, it's exciting, exciting, weird. Why
isn't it's not weird, it's just like in your like, it's it's it's different.
What's it called? I this it's not the one, I thought. It's just, yeah, because
I haven't seen, if you've seen, it's like a different tone, right? Like, it's
not the same as the other comics as you see before. Like, whatever, maybe you
don't. Maybe it doesn't matter. Oh, use your own judgment. Look at it. Let us
know in the comments. Anyway, but what did make a splash was 80s movies, man.
Again, The Lost Boys. Oh man, do those mixes recommendation because we're in
an October spooky season and this is, I guess, makes you like this movie.
You've seen it so many times. I've never seen this before. You've never seen
it in the canal. Kinkel Yeah, I guess I must have missed it. Yeah, yeah, I
must have missed it. Tyler, have you seen this before? No. Never heard of it.
Maybe I've heard of it once or twice. Not really. Yeah. Did you ask your dad
at all about it or your parents? I didn't. I mean, I watched it today, so I
don't really have much time, but I will, and I am pleased about that. I'm glad
we've we've moved on from the 80s. I don't hear it. I don't hate it. So I'll
tell you they were styling, right? But did they add some style? Yes. A lot of
that, a lot of that's coming back around. Yeah. Everything goes in cycles,
right? But yeah, it's a vampire movie place in some town in California and
Clara Sinclair, Santa Clara and Sunny Carlos. Yeah. Now they say, specifically
Santa Carla in the movie, because I thought, I think it's a made up place
tomato place. Yeah, but I mean, it's a made up town. Yeah. And that's I mean,
the premise is these kids family moves, this town depend on it as vampires and
they fight. They need to no more. That's it, then. But it's a lot of weird
stuff in the movie that I want to talk about, but I guess we'll do the
roundtable since we always do this. So we'll start with you because we know,
we know what you want to say. Just say. Much like. And nobody should see it.
Just kidding. I really like to see. I remember watching it a lot when I was a
little kid. It was like just one of those summer movies and like, it's
vampires and like, my mom loves vampire stuff, so I would see it all the time.
I really like it. Okay, Tyler. Is I to to pull out Maxie's line? It was like
it was OK, it was good as an 80s classic movie, if you're in the mood to watch
an 80 and 80s classic movie, you know, it's like. It's hard for me to get in
the mood to watch. It's like the storytelling in movies has changed so much.
Yeah, it's definitely like a mind shift to get into it. But yeah, it was like,
I mean, when you watch it, you know what you're watching. So it was
entertaining, for sure. Cool. All right. And yeah, I resonate with everything
you said. I honestly, at first it was so hard to watch. I started watching it
on the plane and I was like, I I can't. It's just like, Why are we? Why are we
doing this? It's like you said, it's a mind shift you have to like, like
switch your your what is it like gears a little bit to like. OK, I'm watching
an 80s movie. The pacing is going to be all over the place. And for once, I
Academy Award winning film, right? Like, no, no, it's fine. But it's just like
the style is, it's different. And then once you once you get into it, it does
get better, but it starts pretty rough hatred. Are there any jobs around here?
Nothing legal. Oh my God. That's fine. There's so it's just like I want to
hear. I want to talk more about some of the scenes because I don't know. Yeah,
I'll leave it at that, so anyway, yeah, it's like I enjoyed it towards the
middle portion. The the beginning and the end are a little bit rough for me,
but I think that the middle section was solid. Well, that's for the best part.
I think it was pretty cool. Yeah. All right. So it's I guess what we do want
to make. They say our favorite character so that for me, it's kind of weird. I
guess we can do that. We'll pick a character you want to talk about. And so it
makes you just tell us, who's your favorite character? I have such a favorite
character. Yeah, it's the grandpa. Every time I see the grandpa, this is the
best said. Yes, but that's the best line in the movie. But come on, grandpa
was just so good. He's funny. You know, he's like one of the scenes is like, I
guess I'm not the only one that got laid. I felt like, Oh yeah, it's
situational. Comedy was so funny. Yeah. And there's like that scene where
they're carrying the girl and the kid up the stairs and he's like, he's not
concerned that they're carrying two bodies up the stairs. Like, Did you fill
up the gas tank? No. Yeah. You know, like, it's just like, All right, kids
will be kids, I guess. Like, I like the grandpa. That was the best. So that
was a favorite character. Yeah, I guess he's kind of like he's kind of like at
a place like this is like everybody's like all serious, but he like wraps up
the story too. Yeah. In the end, he wraps it up and then he delivers like the
closing line. You know, it's like one thing I couldn't, couldn't ever stomach
about living in Santa Carla. All the damn vampires could lie. I the ending. I
was like, What the hell did I just watch? Like, he's like Grandpa Van Helsing
with the stakes coming out of his truck. Oh yeah. How did he know he needed it
around the house? It's 80s. I mean, like to be fair, though, like you're
hearing like you're probably driving home, you're seeing your house like this
happening because like one of the vampires blew up, one of the other ones had
like a beam of light coming towards them. One of them died by a stereo like,
you're driving home, you're like, Oh shit, going down at home. Yeah, that, I
guess. Or, you know, I guess he was the 80s. I literally thought he was a
California Van Helsing who drives around with the truck full of snakes. Well,
was it the truck full of snakes? I think he just ran because earlier in the
scenes you see him pulling down the a wooden post fence. So I think he just
rammed that. Yeah, I think he just rammed the fence and they went through with
him. You mean they had that good of continuity and I missed it. Yep. Yes, it
is, sir. And you mentioned, I think you told me yesterday that you can see the
grandpa preparing for like fighting vampires, right? So I guess he kind of
knew already. So I rewatched it today. So like one of the first lines that he
mentions is like Santa Clara, Santa Carla is the number one murder capital of
the United States or something. And like later in the scenes, you could see a
lot of missing persons pictures. They make it really obvious that people just
die here. So like. So the grandpa knew from the beginning that's why he's
always being weird and. I think he's just been weird because it's a weird
grandpa. Yeah, but I mean, he knew at the end when he's like, Oh, it's all the
damn vampire. It's like he knew from the beginning that there's a lot of
vampires in the area. Do you have a, I guess that makes already stole it? But
oh yeah, he's my favorite dude. My favorite. And I guess my second favorite
would be the comic book Boys the year. I don't know the one with an
obnoxiously deep voice that didn't make any sense because we kind a raspy
voice, right? I don't even know. Yeah. Are you talking about sorry? Uh, yeah,
really? Yeah. Does he just naturally have a deep voice? Yes. Edgar Frog and
Allen Frog. That's just their names in the movie. Yeah, that yeah, that's so
those those two guys, the comic book guys. Yeah. So that guy and the main
character from the the brother, the little brother. They were known as The
Coreys in the 80s. You're super famous because they were in all kinds of
movies together together, they called them The Coreys. So his voice is
naturally that deep. That's not like he's not forcing nah. Nah, that's that's
fascinating. No, man. It just doesn't sound natural. Like, I mean, nothing
against it. Just. No, it doesn't. I thought he was faking it. I thought he was
going to drop it later, but I guess he'd never did. I thought the vibe was
like a kid doing an adult voice. That's not doing because he was trying to be
all tough. Ah, OK, today all I. At that point, he was probably the movie's 87.
I'll say he was like mid-teens early, yeah, mid-teens teens. Yeah, I guess
actors are usually a little older than they look too, so that's fair. But
yeah, they were they were cool. The scene where they like, Oh, we haven't
talked about scenes yet, but whatever when they yeah, yeah, they have, they
are like armed to the teeth with their steaks and stuff. It's pretty funny.
Yeah. So, all right, so I'll go. My favorite character, so honorable mention
the saxophone guy. He had nothing to do in this movie, but damn, we have a
long scene. That thing went for like five minutes. He played the entire song
and I was like, That's like. I looked him up as like this guy famous. He's not
he was, he is like. He was part of some band with some lady is the scene where
the dude's looking for star. The girl like, he's just like, that's when he met
he. He meets her like, he says. And they're at the concert and the this guy's
just rocking because when his big chain is buff, dude playing the saxophone,
it's like all greased up. He's playing the saxophone for a long time. For a
movie. It's the it's the precursor to the saxophone guy. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I
know it's funny. It's like, Yeah, I mean, so I thought it was the same guy as
like, I mean, look, this guy, but it's not the same guy. Yeah, but it sounds
that to me. I mean, it's not like it's just an honorable mention because I
really don't have a favorite character, though, like all over the place. Wow.
OK. My second film would have to be star. She had like three lines. It's like,
No. And then like, what was the main character's name? Michael Michael
Michael? No, it's blood. Yeah, Michael Michael. No. Also, she said, the whole
movie. Michael? No, Michael, are you OK? It's blood, Michael. Yeah. So those
two, it was like it was blood. Yeah, it was like blood, wasn't it? Oh yes, you
don't. Yeah, I said that. Yeah. Well, she a vampire, too. Yes, she was the
half vampire. How does that work? Does she hadn't killed somebody yet? Yeah,
that's a good. Returned. That's a good talking point, because I'm curious like
how standard this is as far as vampire stories go. Yeah, let's get into that
because. And I listen to that. Yeah, we can go into that. All right. So we
don't know where the vampires come from. No, that's fine. Perfect segue,
because I'm curious about that because I know everybody in the game was a
vampire, but we never see star turn. We see everybody else turned, but not not
her. And she's a half vampire who? Who did Michael kill? He didn't kill
anybody. He didn't kill anybody. He didn't turn either. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we
were. Kid was a full vampire. Wasn't a kid, either. Bitcoin, really? Because
he had teeth. Yeah. But I don't think it wasn't her kid. It was just a A. It
was just. Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You see him in a in a milk carton
and at one point a milk carton. Yeah. Got it. Got it. Yeah, it was some kid.
But he also didn't turn. He did turn, but he wasn't. Was he a full vampire?
No, he wasn't. Oh, that's true, because it became normal again because he
where they were in the Sun, remember? And they didn't blow up, but he was the
only half vampire that they showed with teeth, which I thought was weird. But
maybe it's also Michael had teeth. Michael? Yeah, I missed a lot with this
one. Sorry, I was trying to watch it while I was working. No, that's not good.
It's OK. But yeah, so Michael Michael did like, go have like half vampire at
the end and the little kids scare the crap out of me. That's the term. Yeah,
do I? Sterling? I didn't expect that thing to come, and it was scary to the
vampires. They didn't hold back the looks. So scary. Yeah. So I don't know. So
rules, do they match up as a whole? I mean, if it varies across different
like. Films and stuff, as I know, have seen that one, but I've also seen that
for werewolves like werewolves me to kill somebody before they turn into full
werewolves. Or like that to kill their best friend, like in the case there. So
they just like pick and choose. I mean, I've seen, I guess I've seen a few
vampire movies and they're all a little different because then this one is
garlic doesn't work, right? You know, the holy water does. But holy water,
that one, I don't get it at all because they're the spawn of Satan, man. I
doesn't cross it just because. But why does the garlic not work? Because it's
stupid. Why would garlic work? Why would holy water work? I don't know.
Because because they're literally like they made a deal with the devil. Like,
supposedly how that's how Dracula came about. Or, like Dracula is the
progenitor of all vampire or all their money. And so you made a deal with the
devil and then. You know. OK. Holy it works against evil shit, right? Yeah,
that's fair. Yeah, that's that's fair, I guess, I mean, for what it's worth,
but. So drinking so it normally in other movies, the way I knew it is, if a
vampire bites you, then you become a vampire, too. And this that also varies.
That also varies because then some of the movies you have, like if you watch
like Twilight and like Blade and all that, like, it's a poison. Like they have
something when they bite you, they're like spit turns into a vampire. Hmm.
Some of them, they do like, you have to drink my blood and then you become a
vampire, too. That's what keeps me like. That's how they keep it pure, right?
Because like otherwise, anybody that they eat would turn into a vampire. Like,
sometimes you have to kill people, you know? So that's also very. So in this
one, the Michael drank or everybody drank somebody's blood. And that had
become OK. Yeah, I don't know that that was fine. So I guess, should you know,
one thing I wanted to point out or talk about was the the cave scene when
Michael follows these guys. Into the Cucina eating that food chain. I didn't
understand it. I was like, How are they also like vampires doing magic to all
psychic powers? Yes. So they can fly. They have psychic powers and sometimes
they fly uncontrollably. Yes. And I've never seen them before air. Help me.
Yeah, that was frustrating to watch, but. Yes. So the cue scene that's where
Michael turns like follows these guys and he's OK. Rewind a little bit. So
see, Michael finds star and he's like, Oh, let's go eat. And then start is
like, OK, I'm going to go with you. And then like the main, the main bad guy.
Or I forget his name, but the blonde vampire is a star. Let's go. And then she
just goes, It's like, does he have any power over her or like, What's the
deal? I don't understand. That's funny. That's the that was the scene. I
realized, Oh, we're watching a vampire movie. No. So man, these are all
continuity man. You guys missed all this stuff. So the plan was she was
supposed to kill him and make him like that was supposed to be her first kill.
No, he's talking about the first the first cave scene. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So
that was the whole point of her going with him was because he was supposed to
be her first like kill so that she would turn into a vampire. But but it
couldn't kill him because the daddy vampire wanted him so that he could turn
into a vampire to convince the mom to turn into a vampire for DHS here, man.
Yeah, I see. Yeah, so. Okay. Yeah, they talked about it a little bit at the
end, but I didn't didn't backtrack it to the beginning. I should watch it
again so I can see that that came in. I got 20 plus years of watching this.
Really, I yeah. Yeah, you know this movie? Cool. Cool. Now, now the movie is
more interesting. Yeah, it's actually got really good continuity. Like, I know
you guys are like hating on it, but it did a pretty good job of like tying
things together. The art thing. It's the 80s like pacing. Yeah, it's it's a
little strange because it's like he's chasing after this girl in like creepy
way. Honestly, yes, very creepy. He just looks at me like, I'm going to chase
you. And then this group of dudes are kind of, well, I guess. Is that a mind
control thing? They're the reason why he followed is because they kind of
convinced him to, not because he was jealous, because he's an alpha male. But
see, that doesn't take the girl you took the girl that I wanted to bang. So
I'm going to go hang out with you and ride me with, Yeah. He wants part of the
cool kids. But I wrote that off. It's like eighties cop. Yeah, man, isn't it?
I mean, we could explain it a whole bunch of different ways. All I know is
they when they went into that cave and as a child, I hated that scene because
it was the scariest scene in the world. Like, eat the rice, Michael tells the
maggots, Michael maggots. And then it dried, and then he left its worms. It's
where it's just noodles, Michael. I like how they just say his name. Michael,
Michael, Michael. Yeah. So I guess since we're on this, it's like, Go ahead,
go ahead. And then the chicks like, Don't drink it. It's blood. And he's like,
Ha stupid. You've been saying that all day and then he drinks it. And so I
guess I have two two scenes that I want to like. Like, Can I talk trash about?
Can I talk to you first? Yeah, go ahead. This scene to my I. I've never been
able to figure this out. So, you know, after the scary like, I'm floating away
and he's figuring out he's becoming a vampire. Yeah, he goes to the cave to go
talk to star. And then they kiss, and then they have sex. It's like, Why?
Yeah, it didn't. I did not get that at all. I was like, I guess, I guess you
have to have a sex scene because it's a scary movie. It was the eighties,
right? It was like, it's was like, this scene made no sense. The sequence of
events is like, It's OK, Michael sex. It's like, what? It's like an 80s. Like
the scene where they like, fade the one scene over. It's like they didn't even
play the in the air tonight. Yeah, I was like, that scene was like, no sense.
If this doesn't make it into the movie, it doesn't remove. It doesn't break it
or make it like this totally does for the fan service what it was a setup so
that grandpa can say. I guess I'm not the only one that got laid. You know?
Yeah. You know the the continuity thing you were talking about. She was
supposed to kill him when she said that I thought that that was the time she
was supposed to kill him. That's how I that's how I made it in my brain, but
maybe it's wrong. No, no, because at that point, the daddy vampire wanted to
convert the kids so that the mom would so he she couldn't kill him because she
he needed to be. Yeah, that's fair. That's just what I thought as I was
watching it. But I got I got years. I got you. Yeah. All right, so they that I
want to talk trash about is like when the mom or is like, it's like a weird
cringe scene, it's like the moms the mom is, you just get to town and she's
walking around and she goes to the video store and she's like, Oh, so dumb.
That's like, why? Why do they make? It was such a weird. She was like, I need
a job or like, I don't know, she says, You look like you need a job. Am I so
desperate? Like what? Why is this so strange? You just like, do that bad
writing and acting? That's like, yeah, it's like unnecessary. I guess that's
what we show that he falls in love with her or like he wants her. He showed
that she was a good mom because the little kid was lost. So she's like, Let me
help you find your mommy? And he's like, Oh, this could be my bride. Yeah,
that's all that is. But since I didn't say it was good. But it is, but it was
a bad scene. Anyway, that's and I forgot the other one. I think it must have
been the sex scene because I was also like, what? What the fuck? But sex scene
is the best that it's like, Why is this here? Yeah. Oh, so they could put it
in the trailer? Yeah, there you go. I have no idea. I'm just going to imagine
it. Probably. It probably was. Yeah. What did you guys think? So this is a
scary movie, right? Or is supposed to be? What did you guys think of the like
parts that had a bunch of gore, like the when they go and they kill their son
when they kill people and they don't like actually killing people at the fire,
at the fire pit, killing the punch in the Aerosmith? Yeah. What do you guys
sing on fire? I thought there was out of place. Honestly. It's a little weird
at the bottom, it just didn't fit the tone of the movie, in my opinion. Right.
The other thing was. But it's OK because they were killing Nazis. That's what
they're credited as surf Nazi, one surf Nazi, too. I did see that in the
credits. Yeah, it was weird. Yes. Kind of like escalates, right, it's like,
look like an OK movie, like there's boys, be boys, you know, hang from the
bottom of the of the railroad track jumping down into then like all of a
sudden like turn into like these creatures, these vampires. And it's scary,
man, the costume and they just start biting. And then, like blood gushing
everywhere, it's like what? It's like. But that's like a horror movie, right?
That's like the vampire thing. You have to feed it, you know? And then to I
didn't think it was scary at all. I just it just really felt out of place for
me. That's all it was. The other thing that was out of place was when they in
the house scene, when they kill the guy in the bathtub and the entire plumbing
for the house blows up and there's blood like way more blood than it's in any
human body. Yeah. Yeah. But that kind of falls under the the pretenses that
they showed up, because when they kill that dude in the cave, he just burst
out as a fountain as well. It's like, Well, look at all this black goo
everywhere. And then before they kill the vampires they're talking about, like
no vampire dies the same way. So because one of them died with that way, the
other one died with the singing No explosion. So the one with the radio? Yeah,
but I honestly thought it was too much. I was like, Yeah, it was. It was a
scary scene. It was scary when he came back from the water. They got me. I was
like, Oh my God, it's going to come back up. But I still looked like I still
got scared. You can see it going down the drain too, though, like all the
girls show it. Yeah, but it's it's I get it. I mean, the toilet. The toilet
blew up. Come on part of the floor. That was. It's a little much. It's a
little much. It's is the 80s had that stuff, right? They go a lot of those
scary movies had that good stuff. Yeah. But yeah, I agree out of place or too
much, you know, you could be just like flushing under. Okay, what about that
dude that died by stereo? Huh? Yeah. State like someone's shooting with an air
disaster? Yeah, I want to explode it, right? So, yep. And what about the the
final, the final fight, the final fight with Michael? And I forget his name. I
should have written it down. But the main, the guy that we are led to believe
that is the main vampire at the. David. Yeah. David, you respect that man,
sir. That's Kiefer Sutherland. All right. Yeah. I'm not saying he's bad. I'm
just saying, like the fight. It's a little weak, in my opinion. You thought it
was weak. I thought it was pretty good for the 80s. You're looking at it at
those lens from now. Like for the 80s, it was kind of a cool scene. And like
him flying around, slapping him in the face and stuff like that, yeah, like
like you could see them like clash in the air and then they just something
that was like kind of cool play with the shadows a little bit. Yeah, that's
good. Okay. I just thought, like you kind of like they give you too many hints
as to what's going to happen, right? Like they keep going to the the the steak
like the oh yeah, that's definitely true. Yeah, yeah. It's like it was like
they like the look at the camera pans over to the thing where they're going to
get styling and the camera pans back to the fighting and then talk to you
like, Oh, and keep going back. I was like, Oh God, guy's like, Hey, I wonder
what's going to happen? I wonder what's going to happen now, gee? So that's
the stuff that I. But I guess the fight was OK, but then they stab them and
they play that banger song. Still, not like, I don't like that. I love it. And
then the light, the light is very political. You know, it's like, Whoa, Jesus,
like, OK, OK. Yeah, yeah. Where did the line come from? Nobody knows. Nobody
knows. Because, yeah, you see him go away. He turns back into a human, but
he's not. But then Michael is still a vampire. So everybody else. Well, what
about that plot twist, though? The plot twist? Did you guys expect the video
guy to be the main, the main Dracula or main vampire? I guess. I'm not going
to lie. I don't remember my original reaction. I mean, you were probably a
kid. I did not expect them. I did not expect it. I did. And then I went away.
Originally I was well. I questioned it when they were like, You know, I was
like, Oh, isn't the best thing, isn't the key for David, the the head guy. And
then I was like, Oh, that's too easy, because then they're they're looking for
the head guys. And I was like, Is it him? And then they're testing him. And
then it's like, Oh, when he when he asked to be invited into the house, I was
like, Oh, he is. And then I kind of went away from it. After that, I thought
they did a they did a good job with that part of the storytelling, I thought,
Yeah. I didn't catch it. Yeah. I didn't catch the part where they invited him
into the thing like I heard it, but I was like, Why? Why is he being so weird
about it? Are you being an aggressive mate? Yeah. So I guess it makes sense
because they explained the rules. So yeah, yeah, I did not see it coming. I
was like Nike illegally. They're they're establishing all these things, man.
There's there's I. I let my guard down because they were like some. They were
making everything obvious, so I let my guard down. So maybe, maybe that was
the effect they were going for. You know, was like, Oh, they'll never see this
coming. Yeah. I mean, they they did basically explain that away. Well, you let
me in. So it rendered you powerless. Like, Yeah, but man, that's stamina
enough. That guy like three dates like well and then like half dates. But I
mean, like, I mean, let's be real. Like, if that happens to you, I'm kind of
like pissing out on the first one. It's like, this is not worth it. Yeah, man.
If I see my date just running out without saying anything, I'll be like, You
know what? Ghosted. Because this guy's name, he's been waiting for her. He's
patient, persistent patient. Yeah. So what is it? What else does he have to
do? Go work at a video store. Yeah, but yeah, man, that's that's. I definitely
recommend watching this movie. I don't know if you could watch is definitely
if you're epileptic. What is it called epileptic? Yeah. You do not watch this.
Are you going to have an attack? I guess it's also an interesting right to do
that flashing thing a lot. Yeah. They didn't care back then. Didn't care. It's
it's uncomfortable for me to watch that. So yeah, if you have that, don't
watch this movie, you will have. It'll be bad, but otherwise recommended.
Probably not. With Kid, it is rated R. There are some parts that are, I mean,
actually watch as a child. So I guess he's scarred for life. But yeah, it's
it's it's one of those that it's it's for the most part, is fine. And then
there's like a few parts there's like you guys could tone it down a notch.
Yes, but guys want a fun fact. Yeah. Well, so it's then being rebooted very
soon. Oh, it is interesting. OK? Is that your goal behind this, huh? It was
not. It's something that I found out recently. I was like, Oh. Okay. You know,
I don't know, man, I almost don't want them to report this because I don't
know if they could be. I'm still going to watch it because I'm curious now if
it doesn't have those weird, awkward pauses, awkward lines like the grandpa
with the did the last. That last line of the grandpa is like, what I was so
thrown off was like, what else is there to let you know that people knew
vampires were a thing? That's it. But that's how the movie ends. Yeah. And
then what's going to happen with star? What's going to happen? Like, are they
together now or they together now? Oh my god. Let me talk about this because
this has bugged me for so long and not just this movie, it just every single
like movie since I was born. We're like the main character has a love
interest, and then they just get life together at the end of the movie. And
I'm just always wondering, like. What happened after? Like, like like like in
this case, they're like, what, 20 something, right? Like no potential for it.
Now that is the oldest high school student I've ever seen in my life. But
that's how they do it in the movies. They have, like 30 year old people
pretending in high school anyway. Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, Are they together
forever? Is that what I'm allowed to believe? Like, I want the rom com after
this. Yeah, yeah. Not enough material meant to make a movie, but yeah, I don't
know. I don't know. And the kid does go back to his parents. I don't know,
man. It's all like too many things that I need to know. But anyway, that's it.
I'm done with this movie. I probably. Well, one more thing. Do you see how
that kid was complaining about leaving Phoenix to go to that place like bro,
like, were you like, have you been actually, the Phoenix is hot. Like, I'd be
so stoked. Great. She was like, Let's go back to Phoenix. Yeah. You have a
beach. It's like nice weather. Trees look nice. Yeah, go back to Phoenix.
What? Like, Yeah, I'm in Phoenix right now, man. I can't. I miss. I miss the
trees. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's like, like, if I moved somewhere
nicer, I would be like, I mean, don't get me wrong, guys like this. Plenty of
parking. Ample parking everywhere. Everywhere you go, you can park. I can take
three rows and it was still enough for everybody else to park so much parking
lot, man. Yeah, it's so, so weird. I know I've been here before, but like
after not being here for a while, it's like the hell more parking lot than
stores. Convenient. Huh. Yeah, like it seems like it just seems wasteful by
whatever means. But yeah, that kid doesn't even know what he's got like now.
Hopefully, you up after that whole episode, he'll appreciate the houses. Maybe
they'll have to move back to Phoenix. Yeah, but yeah. Okay, all right. Well, I
think I think we pretty much summed it up one more fun fact. One more fun fact
Bella from life also moved from Phoenix to bend or whatever it is. Oh, that's
yeah, it's Washington, it's actually like a three hour like a three hour drive
from where I live. I'm just saying if you're moving somewhere, you're probably
going to from Phoenix to somewhere else. There's probably vampires there.
That's that's all. There you go. That's what you're saying. Okay. That's the
connection right there. So I I've been wanting to go to that part of
Washington because I've heard it's pretty nice, but it's quite a drive three
hour drive into the middle of nowhere. Basically, folks, a small town. Another
fun fact there's vampire blood is also glittery in the lost boys. Oh, go back
and watch you in the cupboard. Yeah, this is glittery. So vampires are
glittery in a lot of the places. Insane fantasy. The universe is asking the
same universe continuity and continuity. All right. And with that, catch you
in the next one piece. Oh, see you later. Thank you for listening. If you like

TikTok, formerly Musica.ly, was one of those apps that caught major adoption and everyone is pretty much either using it or creating content for it. In this episode, we&amp;rsquo;re joined by Morgan Nelson (&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mrnelson06">@mrnelson06&lt;/a>), a TikTok content creator, about his project &amp;ldquo;Between Now and Thanskgiving&amp;rdquo; where he created a side dish a day. Join us!&lt;br>

This movie separates itself from the original franchise by going rated R which is, in our humble opinion, what it desperately needed. Join us as we discuss our favorite characters and scenes.&lt;br>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, this is an enjoyable movie, highly recommended for the stellar acting and, of course, Emma Stone.&lt;/p>

10:59 Estella is a Misfit&lt;br>
11:20 Estella is a Fasion Genius&lt;br>
12:10 This escalates quickly&lt;br>
12:52 Who are they asking for help?&lt;br>
15:16 Mexy predicts Buddy is gonna die&lt;br>
16:13 Is it considered stealing to take coins from the fountain?&lt;br>
17:22 Little kids ruininng Mexy&amp;rsquo;s dreams&lt;br>
17:43 Estella&amp;rsquo;s New Life as a Criminal&lt;br>
17:52 Wink!&lt;br>
18:90 This is where the movie actually starts&lt;br>
18:40 Estella wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy with her life&lt;br>
19:10 Mexy&amp;rsquo;s first gripe, everything up to now could be sped up or omitted&lt;br>
19:23 How many times do we need to see Uncle Ben die?&lt;br>
20:21 Estella Just wants to make Dresses for a Living&lt;br>
21:10 Continue Editing here!&lt;br>
21:55 Estella gets trashed and trashes the store&lt;br>
22:41 The baroness shows up because Estella stole all those wishes&lt;br>
22:58 The baroness is a famous fashion designer&lt;br>
23:53 Fat and smell like anchovies&lt;br>
24:43 This is where the movie gets exciting&lt;br>
26:30 Blow my whistle baby&lt;br>
26:32 How do whistles even work?&lt;br>
27:50 Kind of hard not to see the CGI&lt;br>
27:27 The Birth of Cruella&lt;br>
27:41 Cruella is evil but not really but she&amp;rsquo;s kind of a jerk.&lt;br>
29:12 Is Cruella mentally ill?&lt;br>
29:28 Cruella is like Batman&lt;br>
30:20 Cruella&amp;rsquo;s Fate was Sealed&lt;br>
30:34 Cruella meets Hunger Games&lt;br>
31:24 It&amp;rsquo;s not a moth egg, it&amp;rsquo;s a cocoon&lt;br>
31:49 Baroness took it to the face like champ!&lt;br>
32:58 Cruella jumps the shark, the baroness is her real mother!&lt;br>

34:21 Ahh don&amp;rsquo;t say that!&lt;br>

35:20 Do you think that they tried to make Cruella bad or made you feel bad for her?&lt;br>

42:33 Mid Credit Scene&lt;br>
43:32 Are they gonna follow through and make the new Cruella bad to the bone?&lt;br>
43:43 A sequel that&amp;rsquo;s a prequel&lt;br>
44:14 Give us a romcom instead&lt;br>
44:35 This movie shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;br>
45:25 At the end we see hints of getting 101 dalmatians&lt;br>
45:53 Cartoon Cruella is an exaggeration&lt;br>
46:15 Cruella drives like a maniac IRL too&lt;br>

&lt;p>In short, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t one of our favourites as it takes twists and turns in certain parts of the movie that take away from the experience. The concept of the dream world is a very cool one though.&lt;/p>

Would you turn down &lt;strong>$4 MILLION&lt;/strong> dollars?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The creators of The Paper Tigers did just that! They had an idea for a movie who&amp;rsquo;s main character was of Asian descent, but Hollywood wanted them to change that, so they walked away. They turned to the community and were able to secure enough funding to make this movie happen, and we&amp;rsquo;re glad they did!&lt;/p>

This week we have a double feature, Falcon and the Winter Soldier season finale and Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Without Remorse! We&amp;rsquo;ve been watching FATWS for the past few weeks and here are our thoughts on the whole season. On a different beat, Tom Clancy&amp;rsquo;s Without Remorse just aired in Amazon Prime Video so we had to tune in. This is an action movie starring Michael B. Jordan. We share our overall thoughts on this movie. Remember as always, there will be spoilers!&lt;/p>

Continuing our preparation for Mortal Kombat (2021), we took on Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, and, boy, do we have some thoughts about this movie. This movie gives you an appreciation for how far the film industry has gone in terms of CGI and plot development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you decide to watch this movie, treat it as a study instead of something you&amp;rsquo;d watch for enjoyment. Perhaps, this movie is a product of it&amp;rsquo;s time, but more than likely, it was just poorly executed. Anyway, join us as we discuss this movie!&lt;/p>

There&amp;rsquo;s not much in the way of plot, but oh the cheese is there and the jokes still land the same way as they did in 1995. Join us as we discuss this movie.&lt;/p>

As innovation advances, regulating technology becomes a challenge. In the documentary, Coded Bias, we follow the store of Joy Buolamwini as she discovers that there&amp;rsquo;s an inherent bias in the data used to train AI algorithms. This takes us to a deeper conversation of how these algorithms are being used and where.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we think about it, we can see that these types of technology advancements can put some people at a disadvantage, further setting them apart. The Pubstomp team reflects on this and discuss their own encounters with erroneous AI in the wild.&lt;/p>

In 2017, the film Justice League appeared on the big screen and&amp;hellip; it was poorly received. This was an attempt to bring the DC universe together into a much bigger vision, but unlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t connect with the audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally, the Justice League was directed by Zack Snyder, but due to some mishaps, he had to leave the production, and the hand it to someone else, who took some liberties and changed things here and there. Years later, the original script got leaked and the people DEMANDED to see this cut.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2020, HBO came to the rescue and announced that the Snyder&amp;rsquo;s Cut would be released in their streaming platform. So here we are at last! A FOUR hour experience with the original vision of Zack Snyder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Join us as we discuss the nitty gritty details and compare against the original Justice League.&lt;/p>
