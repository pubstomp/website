We had a busy last few weeks so instead of leaving you with an empty feed, we decided to resurrect one of our early episodes about custom mechanical keyboards.

---
This is our first installment of our Keeb Talk miniseries. You've more than likely heard the buzz around mechanical keyboards, in this episode we walk you through what a mechanical keyboard is and why they're a sought after peripheral. There's a small but growing community of keyboard enthusiasts, hopefully after listening to this you can come along for the ride, even if just as a spectator!
