Upon listening to an episode of Trash Taste, mexy sprung up the question "What anime did YOU grow up watching, trigoman?". In this episode, we talk about the anime we grew up watching on TV without knowing it was anime. We take a stroll through memory lane into our college years and talk about what anime stuck to our core and why. Stick til the end to find out how we met Jessica Nigri for the first time before she was ultra famous!
