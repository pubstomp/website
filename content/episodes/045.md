We've been planning this episode for quite a while, but at last it is here! Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist is a musical comedy-drama where the protagonist is aware of the music unlike other musical TV series where the music is there but the characters aren't aware of it. Check out the show notes for links to all the songs discussed!
