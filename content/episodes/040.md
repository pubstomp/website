This week we have a double feature, Falcon and the Winter Soldier season finale and Tom Clancy's Without Remorse! We've been watching FATWS for the past few weeks and here are our thoughts on the whole season. On a different beat, Tom Clancy's Without Remorse just aired in Amazon Prime Video so we had to tune in. This is an action movie starring Michael B. Jordan. We share our overall thoughts on this movie. Remember as always, there will be spoilers!
