In 2014, the MonsterVerse was rebooted with the film Godzilla, followed by Kong: Skull Island (2017), and Godzilla: King of Monsters (2019). It is now 2021, and we now have Godzilla vs. Kong, and it is just what you'd expect, two Titans battling it out for the title of King!

Join us as we take a light hearted approach at reviewing this movie. We poke fun at some of the plot holes but give credit where credit is due. Ultimately, this is a must watch, so if you haven't seen it yet, pause, go watch it, then come back and join us!
