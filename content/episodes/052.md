When this movie was announced, we weren't sure quite how to feel about it. In one hand, this could be a chance to relive the magic that Space Jam (1996) brought to us in our youth, on the other hand, it could ruin it all. Space Jam: A New Legacy, had some good parts, but...a lot of bad parts. Join us to hear us discuss the good, the bad, and the ugly about this one.
