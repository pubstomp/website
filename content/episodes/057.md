There's no doubt that the Internet has been growing year after year, but during 2020 many of us were forced to stay indoors so naturally we congregated over the Internet. TikTok, formerly Musica.ly, was one of those apps that caught major adoption and everyone is pretty much either using it or creating content for it. In this episode, we're joined by Morgan Nelson ([@mrnelson06](https://www.tiktok.com/@mrnelson06)), a TikTok content creator, about his project "Between Now and Thanskgiving" where he created a side dish a day. Join us!
