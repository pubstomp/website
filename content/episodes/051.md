Black Widow was slated to come out before Falcon and the Winter Soldier, but when the pandemic hit, everything was delayed. But that's neither here nor there, the fact is that Black Widow is now here and it is action packed without having to worry much about how it's all gonna affect the rest of the MCU. Join us as we discuss our favorite characters and talk about some of the scenes in the movie. If you haven't watched it, please do before digging into this episodes as there will be spoilers, and **don't** forget to watch until the end, there's a stinger!
