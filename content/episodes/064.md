There's been a lull in the Predator universe, up until Prey, the Hulu exclusive. This movie breaks the mold, but preserves many of the tie ins that make this a Predator movie. This time we get to see the interaction with a Predator and a tribe of Commanche while following the story of a young lady, Naru, as she tries to define her own path.
