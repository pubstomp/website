# 034 - SnyderCut: #RestoreTheSnyderverse
In 2017, the film Justice League appeared on the big screen and... it was poorly received. This was an attempt to bring the DC universe together into a much bigger vision, but unlike the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it just didn't connect with the audience.

Originally, the Justice League was directed by Zack Snyder, but due to some mishaps, he had to leave the production, and the hand it to someone else, who took some liberties and changed things here and there. Years later, the original script got leaked and the people DEMANDED to see this cut.

In 2020, HBO came to the rescue and announced that the Snyder's Cut would be released in their streaming platform. So here we are at last! A FOUR hour experience with the original vision of Zack Snyder.

Join us as we discuss the nitty gritty details and compare against the original Justice League.
