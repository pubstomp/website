GRIS is a game created by [Nomada Studio](https://nomada.studio/). From the website:

> Gris is a hopeful young girl lost in her own world, dealing with a painful experience in her life. Her journey through sorrow is manifested in her dress, which grants new abilities to better navigate her faded reality. As the story unfolds, Gris will grow emotionally and see her world in a different way, revealing new paths to explore using her new abilities

To say that GRIS is a video game, is not doing it justice. GRIS is more of an interactive movie combined with a platforming game. It utilizes the most beautiful art to tell you a story, and as you progress, the world transforms. In short, this game deserves a spot in your Steam library.
